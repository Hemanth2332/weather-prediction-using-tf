## Introduction
The goal of this project is to streamline the process of preparing machine learning models for deployment in environments with limited computational power. The project focuses on converting Keras models into TFLite format while offering flexibility for customization.

## Features
- Model creation using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Flexible architecture with layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Dropout, etc.
- Training pipeline with adjustable parameters.
- Transfer learning approach for improved performance.
- Model conversion to TFLite format.
- Ready-to-deploy TFLite model generation.

## Requirements
The project requires the following dependencies:

- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `os`

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Ensure your dataset is accessible and formatted as specified in the notebook.

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute the cells to create, train, and convert the model.

3. **TFLite Model**:
   - The generated TFLite model will be saved in the specified directory.

## Transfer Learning Approach

The project incorporates a transfer learning approach using the ResNet-50 model to leverage pre-trained weights for better results. This method offers several advantages:

- Improved performance on smaller datasets.
- Faster convergence during training.
- Better loss and validation accuracy graphs, as observed during experimentation.

The transfer learning approach fine-tunes the ResNet-50 model with additional layers to adapt to the specific dataset. The final results include:

- A well-trained model with improved accuracy and reduced overfitting.
- A seamless transition to TFLite format for deployment.

## Output
- A trained TensorFlow Lite model file.


## Notes
- TFLite models are optimized for inference but might require further fine-tuning depending on the target platform.
